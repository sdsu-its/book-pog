# Policy & Operation Guide

This document includes two sections, the first listing all of the policies that apply to student assistants working with ITS in either Learning Spaces or Faculty Support. These policies must be followed, with no exceptions. The seconds section covers day to day operations and should be used as a guide to providing support and completing day to day tasks. Operations precedents should generally be followed, but can be deviated from if necessary in special circumstances.
