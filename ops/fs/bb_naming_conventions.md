## Course Names

* **For all homerooms \(-HR\),**
   please refer to Jon \(the creation of a HR requires a face-to-face meeting with him\).
* **For all courses,**
   double-check that your usage of upper and lower case, underscores and dashes. 

| **TYPE OF COURSE** | **REASON** | **EXAMPLE** | **NOTES** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Development Course | Create for instructors for course prep, practice area, and storage. | **JRizzo-MATH120-DEVEL**\(not MATH120-DEVEL\) | To avoid duplication, use first initial and last name. |
| Training Course | Created by ITS staff for workshops and demos. | **JRizzo-GRADEBOOK-TRAIN** | To avoid duplication, use first initial and last name. |
| Backup Course | Sometimes these replace a “broken course.” | **BIOL101-01-Fall2016-BK**or**BIOL101-01-Fall2016-TEMP**or**BIOL101-01-Fall2016-COPY** | Use course name with “-BK”, “-TEMP”, or “-COPY” so the courses are easy to find. |

An underscore separates individual sections in a CX course while a dash indicates consecutive courses. If all sections are being combined, don’t add the section \#s. |
| Study Abroad | For study abroad programs \(various disciplines involved\). | **JRizzo-StudyAbroad-Summer2016** | Add the faculty name as you would in a DEVEL course. Add semester as these are increasing. |
| Restore | Pulled from our ITS archive. | **HIST110-01-Fall2016-RESTORE** | Add “-RESTORE” so we can identify and delete. |
