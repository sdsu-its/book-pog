# Logging into Blackboard

As of January 5th, most users will login to Blackboard via SDSUid. Some users with GUI accounts \(some staff members, ITS staff, clicker users, CES students, etc\) will still need to login with a username and password, which can be accomplished via the [Speakeasy method](#speakeasy-method) listed below.

## SSO Login Issues

There are a few common issues associated with login in via SDSUid \(SAML SSO\), with the associated solution listed below. There are also macros in [Desk](/ops/fs/desk.md) for all of these common responses, sometimes with a bit more detail.

## Speakeasy Method
The new SDSUid login is only for users who previously used their RedID to login to Blackboard. So as not to confuse them, we have hidden the login boxes for those using GUI accounts. 

To reveal these login boxes, visit the Blackboard homepage. Here, you will notice that the name "San Diego State University" appears twice. Click on the "y" at the end of the word "University" in the second appearance of the name. An "Administrative Login" box and "Password" box should appear at the bottom of the home page. Use these boxes to enter your GUI credentials.
