# Desk.com

Desk.com, commonly referred to as Desk, is where we handle most of our support interactions. Emails sent by faculty, staff, and students to one of our shared email accounts \(listed below\) are pulled into Desk and put into one of our groups \(also listed below\).

| Email Address | Assigned Group |
| :--- | :--- |
| bbhelp@sdsu.edu \(alias of cihelp@mail.sdsu.edu\) | Blackboard |
| its.capture@mail.sdsu.edu | Course Capture |
| its.events@mail.sdsu.edu | Events \(Used for Special Events\) |
| its@mail.sdsu.edu | General \(Used by Department Staff\) |
| smartclassroom@mail.sdsu.edu | Smart Classroom |

## Working Cases

When you login to Desk \(you login will be provided to you by your supervisor on your first day at ITS\), you can use either the Classic Agent or the Next Gen Agent \(which is nicer, but slightly less reliable than the Classic Agent\) to work the cases. An orientation for working cases can be found on the [Desk.com Support Website](https://support.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1110369-agent-desktop-orientation?b_id=6373).

### Escalating Cases

Sometimes cases require attention of a lead student or a full-time staff member. Rather than assigning the case to a specific user, you can add the red label **Escalated** to the case, and update the case. Once this is completed, Full Time Blackboard staff and the Lead Student will be notified via Slack and will handle the case from there.

### Labeling Cases

We have a few labels that can be assigned to cases. Labels are used both to categorize cases and to automate actions. Labels can also provide other agent a summary of the case, without needing to open the case and read through al of the interactions (messages). Most labels assigned to Blackboard Cases will begin with `BB` to indicate their association with Faculty Support Cases.
