# iClicker

iClicker is San Diego State University's supported Audience Response System. It 
allows students to respond to questions posted by faculty using either a hand held remote or a web-enabled device such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. More than just an attendance checker, i>clicker can be used for knowledge checks, gathering opinions, conversation starters, and other active learning. Students who are reluctant to raise their hand or participate in class are provided with an alternative means of having a voice in class.

Responses can be collected wither via hand held devices or via the iClicker Reef app on iOS and Android Devices or via the iClicker Student Website on laptops. On the faculty side, there are 2 options, iClicker Classic and iClicker Cloud. Documentation for each of these tools is linked below.

## Classic vs. Cloud
As of the Spring 2018 semester, mixed (using both physical and mobile devices) is not supported by Instructional Technology Services. While mixed response collection is supported by both iClicker Cloud and iClicker Classic there are issues with both that make it very difficult for ITS to support users. For mobile-only response collection, Faculty should use iClicker Cloud; and for physical hand-held remotes, Faculty should use iClicker Classic. These two options are the ones that are supported by ITS at this time.

## iClicker Classic
When paired with a Base Receiver, which is already installed in a few of our larger classrooms - listed at the bottom of this page, iClicker classic can be used to collect responses from hand held devices. The iClicker Classic
