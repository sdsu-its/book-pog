# Clear Browser Session

When things go funky with websites and logins, clearing your cache forces your browser to retrieve the newest copy available from the website, something that should happen automatically but sometimes does not. Internet cookies \(the non-edible type\) are tiny files stored on your hard drive by your browser that contain information about your visit to a particular website, like login status, personalization, and advertising preferences, etc. The steps below describe how to clear the cache and cookies for each of the major browsers. This document is also available as an [article](https://sdsu-its.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2914355-clearing-your-browser-session) in the [Desk](/ops/fs/desk.md) Knowledge Base, so it can easily be shared with clients via macros.

## Chrome: Clear Browsing Data

In Google Chrome, clearing the browser cache and cookies is done via the _Clear browsing data_ area in _Settings_. From there, check **Cached images and files** and **Cookies and other site data** \(as well as anything else you want to remove\) and then tap or click the **CLEAR BROWSING DATA** button.

Assuming you're using a [keyboard](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-keyboard-2618153), the quickest way to _Clear browsing data_ is via the **Ctrl+Shift+Del** keyboard shortcut.

Without a keyboard, tap or click the **Menu** button \(the icon with three stacked lines\) followed by **More tools** and finally **Clear browsing data...**.

See [How to Clear the Cache in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392709?visit_id=0-636388181934126876-2271256505&rd=1) for more details on clearing your cache. See [How to Delete Cookies in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en) for additional information like how to delete cookies from specific websites, how to allow or deny websites from leaving cookies, and more.

**Tip:** Choose **the beginning of time** from the _Clear the following items from_ option at the top of the _Clear browsing data_ window to make sure you get everything.

In Chrome's mobile browser, go to **Settings** and then **Privacy**. From there, choose **Clear Browsing Data**. In this menu, check **Cached Images and Files**, as well as **Cookies, Site Data** and press the **Clear Browsing Data** button once, and then again for confirmation.

## Internet Explorer: Delete Browsing History

In Microsoft Internet Explorer, the browser that comes pre-installed on most Windows computers, clearing the cache is done from the _Delete Browsing History_ area. From here, check **Temporary Internet files and website files** and then click or tap **Delete**. Also, find the option for cookies, which is called **Cookies and website data** and then click or tap **Delete**.

Like with other popular browsers, the fastest way to the _Delete Browsing History_ settings is via the **Ctrl+Shift+Del** keyboard shortcut.

Another option is via the **Tools** button \(the gear icon\), followed by **Safety** and then **Delete browsing history...**.

See [How to Clear the Cache in Internet Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-the-cache-in-internet-explorer-2624707) for a full set of instructions. See [How to Delete Cookies in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/errors?) for more help, like how to delete cookies in older versions of Internet Explorer.

**Tip:** Internet Explorer often refers to the browser cache as _temporary internet files_ but they're one in the same.

## Firefox: Clear All History

In Mozilla's Firefox browser, you clear the cache and Cookies from the _Clear Recent History_ area in the browser's _Options_. Once there, check **Cache **and** Cookies** and then tap or click **Clear Now**. Delete cookies in Mozilla's Firefox browser through the _Clear All History_ window of its _Options_ section. Choose the **Cookies **option and then the **Clear Now **button to erase the cookies in Firefox.

The **Ctrl+Shift+Del** keyboard shortcut is probably the fastest way to open this tool. It's also available from Firefox's Menu button \(the three-lined "hamburger" button\) via **Options**, then **Privacy & Security**, and finally the **clear your recent history** link from the _History_ area. You will then also need to go in and choose **Options &gt; Privacy &gt; clear your recent history **to open the _Clear All History_  section.

Select the **Preferences... **option and then the **Privacy **tab. The buttons I mentioned above are under the section called _Cookies and other website data_.

If you use the **Remove All Website Data... **button, choose the **Remove Now **button to delete all of Safari's cookies. If you want to delete cookies from specific websites, pick the **Details... **button and then select the cookies you want to remove - click or tap **Remove** to delete them.

With a keyboard, clearing the cache in Safari is super easy with the **Option-Command-E** shortcut.
